description: "When Knighthood Was in Flower is the debut novel of American author\
  \ Charles Major written under the pseudonym, Edwin Caskoden. It was first published\
  \ by The Bobbs-Merrill Company (then the Bowen-Merrill Company) in 1898 and proved\
  \ an enormous success.\nAccording to the New York Times, in its third year on the\
  \ market the book was still selling so well that it was #9 on the list of bestselling\
  \ novels in the United States for 1900.\nThe book spawned an entire industry of\
  \ historical romantic novels and films.\nIn 1901, playwright Paul Kester wrote the\
  \ Broadway play and by 1907 When Knighthood Was in Flower was still being printed\
  \ by the reprint publisher, Grosset & Dunlap, when the film rights were sold to\
  \ Biograph Studios.\nIt was sometimes known by the title When Knights Were Bold\
  \ and should not be confused with the 1906 play When Knights Were Bold which also\
  \ inspired several film adaptations.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
